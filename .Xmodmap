! This file must be processed with xmodmap in order to take effect. In
! some desktop environments and depending on your personal
! configuration, this might be done automatically by the startup files.
!
! Use the "xev"-Tool to find out the required keycodes.
!
! Run script "xmodmap-template-generator" to generate a template for
! this file which contains all symbolic names available for mapping.
!
! Alternatively, to do this manually, look into the Files
!
! /usr/include/X11/XF86keysym.h
! /usr/include/X11/keysym.h
!
! to find the symbolic names, like for instance the line
!
! #define XF86XK_AudioLowerVolume 0x1008FF11   /* Volume control down */
!
! Remove the "XK_"-substring from the symbolic #define name in order to
! determine the symbolic name to use in the .Xmodmap file:
!
! Undesired acceleration for keys can be disabled with a command like
!
! $ xset -r 174 -r 176
!
! After xmodmap has successfully processed the assignments, use the
! Xfce4 keyboard shortcurtcut editor in order to assign a function to
! the multimedia key, such as executing an arbitrary program.
!
! If your desktop Environment or Windows Manager does not support such
! hotkey handling, the package xbindkeys can be installled for this as
! a stand-alone solution.
!
! Note that xmodmap can only modify the existing keyboard
! configuration, but it cannot reset it back to some defaults. Use
! "setxkbmap -layout de" to reset the bindings if needed (replace the
! "de" in this example with your preferred layout).
